    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, participants will:\n",
    "- Understand the concept of the p-value and its role in hypothesis testing.\n",
    "- Learn when and how to use t-tests (one-sample, two-sample, and paired).\n",
    "- Explore the ANOVA test and its applications in comparing multiple groups.\n",
    "- Implement these tests in R with practical examples.\n",

    "## Introduction to p-value\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a p-value?\n",
    "- The p-value is a probability that measures the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**:\n",
    "  - A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so we reject it.\n",
    "  - A large p-value (> 0.05) suggests weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so we fail to reject it.\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: Assumes no effect or no difference.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: Assumes a significant effect or difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "In R, you can compute a p-value using various statistical tests (e.g., t-test, ANOVA).\n",

    "### Assumptions\n",
    "- Data is normally distributed.\n",
    "- For a two-sample t-test:\n",
    "  - Variances of the two groups are equal (can be checked with Levene's test).\n",

    "### What is ANOVA?\n",
    "ANOVA is used to compare means of three or more groups to determine if at least one mean is different.\n",
