    "# Lesson: Correlation Analysis in Statistical Studies\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, participants will:\n",
    "- Understand the concept of correlation and its significance.\n",
    "- Learn the types of correlation coefficients and their applications.\n",
    "- Perform correlation analysis in R using built-in functions.\n",
    "- Interpret correlation results and visualize them.\n",

    "## 1. What is Correlation?\n",
    "Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "- **Direction**: Indicates whether the relationship is positive or negative.\n",
    "- **Strength**: Ranges from -1 to +1:\n",
    "  - **+1**: Perfect positive correlation.\n",
    "  - **-1**: Perfect negative correlation.\n",
    "  - **0**: No correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Correlation\n",
    "1. **Positive Correlation**: As one variable increases, the other increases.\n",
    "2. **Negative Correlation**: As one variable increases, the other decreases.\n",
    "3. **No Correlation**: No predictable relationship exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Correlation Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pearson Correlation\n",
    "- Measures the linear relationship between two continuous variables.\n",
    "- Assumes variables are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spearman Correlation\n",
    "- Measures the monotonic relationship between two variables.\n",
    "- Does not assume normality; uses ranks instead of raw values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kendall Tau Correlation\n",
    "- Measures the strength of association based on concordant and discordant pairs.\n",
    "- Suitable for small datasets and ordinal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Performing Correlation Analysis in R\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Dataset\n",
    "We will use the built-in `mtcars` dataset.\n",

    "# Pearson Correlation\n",
    "cor(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt, method = \"pearson\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 3.2 Spearman Correlation\n",
    "```r\n",
    "# Spearman Correlation\n",
    "cor(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt, method = \"spearman\")\n",

    "cor(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt, method = \"kendall\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Correlation Matrix\n",
    "A correlation matrix shows pairwise correlations between multiple variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "# Correlation Matrix\n",
    "cor_matrix <- cor(mtcars[, c(\"mpg\", \"wt\", \"hp\", \"disp\")], method = \"pearson\")\n",

    "## 4. Visualizing Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scatter Plot\n",
    "Scatter plots help visualize relationships between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "# Scatter Plot\n",
    "plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, main = \"MPG vs Weight\", xlab = \"Weight\", ylab = \"MPG\", pch = 19)\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Correlation Heatmap\n",
    "Heatmaps provide an intuitive way to visualize a correlation matrix.\n",

    "1. **Strength**:\n",
    "   - Close to +1 or -1: Strong correlation.\n",
    "   - Close to 0: Weak or no correlation.\n",
    "2. **Direction**:\n",
    "   - Positive value: Positive correlation.\n",
    "   - Negative value: Negative correlation.\n",
    "3. **Statistical Significance**:\n",
    "   - Use `cor.test()` to calculate p-values and assess significance.\n",
