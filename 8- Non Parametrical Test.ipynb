    "# Lesson: Non-Parametric Tests in Statistical Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, participants will:\n",
    "- Understand the purpose and applications of non-parametric tests.\n",
    "- Learn the Friedman test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Chi-Square test.\n",
    "- Implement these tests in R with practical examples.\n",
    "- Interpret their results effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction to Non-Parametric Tests\n",
    "Non-parametric tests are statistical methods that do not assume a specific distribution (e.g., normality) for the data. They are useful when:\n",
    "- Data violates normality assumptions.\n",
    "- Sample sizes are small.\n",
    "- Variables are ordinal or nominal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The Friedman Test\n",
    "The Friedman test is used to compare three or more paired groups (e.g., repeated measures).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "1. Data is paired (dependent samples).\n",
    "2. Measurements are at least ordinal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```r\n",
    "# Simulated Data\n",
    "set.seed(123)\n",
    "data <- data.frame(\n",
    "  Subject = 1:10,\n",
    "  Time1 = rnorm(10, mean = 5, sd = 1),\n",
    "  Time2 = rnorm(10, mean = 6, sd = 1),\n",
    "  Time3 = rnorm(10, mean = 7, sd = 1)\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform Friedman Test\n",
    "friedman.test(as.matrix(data[,-1]))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "- If the p-value < 0.05, there is a significant difference among the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test\n",
    "The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric alternative to the paired t-test, comparing two dependent samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "1. Data is paired.\n",
    "2. Differences are symmetrically distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```r\n",
    "# Simulated Data\n",
    "before <- rnorm(20, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n",
    "after <- rnorm(20, mean = 55, sd = 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform Wilcoxon Test\n",
    "wilcox.test(before, after, paired = TRUE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "- If the p-value < 0.05, there is a significant difference between the paired samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. The Mann-Whitney U Test\n",
    "The Mann-Whitney U test (also known as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test) is used to compare two independent groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "1. Data is ordinal or continuous.\n",
    "2. Samples are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```r\n",
    "# Simulated Data\n",
    "group1 <- rnorm(15, mean = 20, sd = 5)\n",
    "group2 <- rnorm(15, mean = 25, sd = 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform Mann-Whitney Test\n",
    "wilcox.test(group1, group2, paired = FALSE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "- If the p-value < 0.05, there is a significant difference between the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. The Chi-Square Test\n",
    "The Chi-Square test evaluates the relationship between categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "1. Data is categorical.\n",
    "2. Expected frequencies are > 5 in at least 80% of cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```r\n",
    "# Simulated Data\n",
    "observed <- c(50, 30, 20)\n",
    "expected <- c(40, 40, 20)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform Chi-Square Test\n",
    "chisq.test(observed, p = expected/sum(expected))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "- If the p-value < 0.05, there is a significant association between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "1. Simulate or load a dataset with paired and independent samples.\n",
    "2. Perform the following tests:\n",
    "   - Friedman test for three paired groups.\n",
    "   - Wilcoxon signed-rank test for two paired samples.\n",
    "   - Mann-Whitney U test for two independent samples.\n",
    "   - Chi-Square test for categorical data.\n",
    "3. Summarize the results in a report, including plots where relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus\n",
    "Try visualizing the differences with boxplots or barplots to enhance the interpretation of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "In this lesson, we covered:\n",
    "- The importance and applications of non-parametric tests.\n",
    "- How to implement and interpret the Friedman test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Chi-Square test in R.\n",
    "- Practical examples and exercises to solidify understanding.\n",
