    "## Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, participants will:\n",
    "- Understand the importance of sample size in research.\n",
    "- Learn about the key factors influencing sample size.\n",
    "- Calculate sample size for common statistical tests using R.\n",

    "## 1. Importance of Sample Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample size plays a critical role in research for:\n",
    "- **Statistical Power**: Ensures that the study can detect meaningful effects.\n",
    "- **Validity**: Prevents over- or underestimation of results.\n",
    "- **Resource Efficiency**: Balances cost, time, and effort with scientific rigor.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Key Factors Influencing Sample Size\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Effect Size**\n",
    "   - The magnitude of the effect you want to detect.\n",
    "   - Larger effect sizes require smaller sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Significance Level (α)**\n",
    "   - The probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis (Type I error).\n",
    "   - Common values: 0.05 or 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Power (β)**\n",
    "   - The probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis (1 - β).\n",
    "   - Common target: 80% or 90%.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Variability**\n",
    "   - Measured by standard deviation or variance.\n",
    "   - More variability requires larger sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Study Design**\n",
    "   - Type of analysis (e.g., t-test, ANOVA, regression).\n",
    "   - Number of groups and measurements.\n",

    "## 3. Sample Size Calculation Methods\n",

    "### 3.1 Formula-Based Approach\n",
    "For a **two-sample t-test**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    " n = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\sigma^2 \\cdot (Z_{\\alpha/2} + Z_{\\beta})^2}{\\Delta^2}\n",
